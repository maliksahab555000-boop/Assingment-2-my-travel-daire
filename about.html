    <h1 align="center">About My Travel</h1>
    <p>I love traveling because it gives me the chance to explore new places and meet different kinds of people. Every journey feels like a new story waiting to unfold. whether its a busy city street or a quiet mountain village, each place has its own charm and energy. I enjoy talking to locals, learning about their culture, and trying new foods along the way. For me, travel is not just a hobby, its a way of growing and discovering life.</p>
